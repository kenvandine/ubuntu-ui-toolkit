    /*!
      List of actions that represent the sections.
      The text of each action is displayed as the section name and clicking
      a section will update the \l selectedIndex.

      When \l selectedIndex is changed (by user interaction or by setting
      the value), actions[selectedIndex] will be triggered.

      Example:
      \qml
        Sections {
            actions: [
                Action {
                    text: "first"
                    onTriggered: print("one")
                },
                Action {
                    text: "second"
                    onTriggered: print("two")
                },
                Action {
                    text: "third"
                    onTriggered: print("three")
                }
            ]
        }
     \endqml
     It is strongly recommended to limit the number of sections to two or three.
     The actions are used as the model for the Sections by default.
     If no trigger functions need to be specified, \l model may be used directly
     without setting the actions property. If both \l actions and \l model are set,
     model overrides the actions.

    /*!

      as input, but if no trigger functions need to be specified, it can be
