Quick+
======

Quick+ provides additional tools, QML items and C++ scenegraph nodes for
QtQuick 2.


Supported Platforms
===================

Linux (tested on Ubuntu Linux 15.04)


Build Instructions
==================

Building the sources requires Qt 5.1.0 or later.

You can build Quick+ with:

  $ cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
  $ qmake
  $ make

You can install Quick+ with:

  $ make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

You can build and run C++ and QML programs using Quick+ uninstalled using the
Quick+ shell:

  $ ./scripts/shell.sh
  Entering Quick+ shell.
  [Quick+] $ _


Environment variables
=====================

A few environment variables are supported:

  QUICKPLUS_NO_GPU_TIMER
      Disable precise GPU rendering time measurement. Since the GPU timers imply
      a flush of GPU rendering commands at each frame, the GPU doesn't exactly
      run as it does without monitoring. This environment variable allows to run
      without explicit flushing of commands. The GPU time will appear in the
      swap time but, because of its asynchronous nature and potential long
      command queue, it is quite possible that it will correspond to the swap
      time of a previous frame.

  QUICKPLUS_NO_LOGGER_COLOR
      Disable coloured logging on stdout and stderr using terminal codes
      (ANSI/VT100).


LTTng support
=============

LTTng support is built by default, it can be disable with:

  $ qmake DISABLE_LTTNG=1

When LTTng is enabled, a dedicated library providing LTTng metrics logging is
built. The provider is "quickplus" and the tracepoint "metrics". The
quick-plus-scene tool supports LTTng, it can be used like that:

  $ lttng create
  $ lttng enable-event --userspace quickplus:window
  $ lttng enable-event --userspace quickplus:frame
  $ lttng enable-event --userspace quickplus:process
  $ lttng start
  $ quick-plus-scene --performance-logging lttng tests/RotatingLogo.qml
  $ lttng stop
  $ lttng view
  $ lttng destroy
