    \qml
        Column {
            Button {
                text: "Send"
                onClicked: print("clicked text-only Button")
            }
            Button {
                iconName: "compose"
                gradient: UbuntuColors.greyGradient
                onClicked: print("clicked icon-only Button")
            }
            Button {
                iconName: "compose"
                text: "Icon on left"
                iconPosition: "left"
                onClicked: print("clicked text and icon Button")
            }

                text: "Click me"
                onTriggered: print("action!")
                iconName: "compose"
            }
            Button {
                anchors.centerIn: parent
                action: action1
                color: UbuntuColors.warmGrey
            }
       }
