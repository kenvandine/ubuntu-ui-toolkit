UbuntuColors.qml is located in the Colors subdirectory because
QuickUtils::createQmlObject() fails if the QML file is located in a
folder that has a qmldir file with JavaScript modules.

UbuntuColors 1.1 is not in a file named UbuntuColors11.qml but in
UbuntuColors.qml so that qdoc can properly detect the component
name without a qmldir file.
